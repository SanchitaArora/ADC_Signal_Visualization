# Real-Time-ADC-Signal-Visualization
This project demonstrates a real-time ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) signal visualization system using Python. The system consists of two components: a server that reads ADC data from a text file and sends it over a socket connection, and a client that receives this data and plots it live using Matplotlib and Tkinter.

# Features
1. Real-time data transmission over TCP/IP sockets
2. Client-side dynamic plotting of ADC signal values
3. Easy integration with different ADC data files
4. Modular Python code for both server and client

# Technologies Used
1. Python 3.x
2. Socket programming
3. Matplotlib for plotting
4. Tkinter for GUI
5. Virtual environments for dependency management
