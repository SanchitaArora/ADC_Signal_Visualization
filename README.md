# Real-Time-ADC-Signal-Visualization-
This project demonstrates a real-time ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) signal visualization system using Python. The system consists of two components: a server that reads ADC data from a text file and sends it over a socket connection, and a client that receives this data and plots it live using Matplotlib and Tkinter.
